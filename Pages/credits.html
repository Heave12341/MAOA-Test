				<p>The story of king Arthur and his legendary sword Excalibur is quite famous, it has led to the creation of many stories with the "sword in the stone" trope. This story draws inspiration from king Arthurs story as well, much more than you think.</p>
				<p>In king Arthurs story, the sword he pulls from the stone is unnamed, it is merely there to see who is the true heir of uther pendragon and thus, england.</p>
				<p>He promptly breaks this sword in one of his early fights and is advised by his magical friend Merlin to seek the lady of the lake, who gives him the real Excalibur.</p>
