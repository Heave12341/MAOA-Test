	<h1>The Dark Blade</h1>
		<article>
			<p>Long ago, before even time had a name, there lived two brothers named Boreas and Eurus. Born of pure void, these cataclysmic constructs of compressed calamity were the closest thing the empty nothingness they called home had as creators.</p>
			<p>Boreas, the lord of chaos, was older, while Eurus, the bringer of order, was younger. Boreas was the creator, his chaos allowed him to create Matter out of nothing. Eurus gave the creations of boreas purpose, lonely were these gods, so they made another sentient being, a wyrm, akin to their flesh, a near godly being, master of elements. It soon began to inhabit the giant rocks created by the brothers, branching off to form many different species, yet they still contained a little blood of the brothers. The brothers themselves decided to move to the largest of these rocks, one they called Ahog Shugnahoth.</p>
			<p>Their language was quite different to ours, they spoke a language from a different world itself, unknown is the method by which it leaked into their world, as is the reason why they adopted it.</p>
			<p>Though they were brothers, Boreas and Eurus barely got along, they were the lords of opposite domains, while they did work together in the beginning their relationship slowly started to deteriorate, until one day Eurus decided to seal his brother, so that he could bring order to the entire realm. He devised a seal so twisted and malign, it was against his nature, the seal was nigh unbreakable, the seal was made from the blood of his children, the longwyrms, and it couldn't be removed, unless all longwyrms were eradicated. It was not an easy task to seal Boreas, but through deceit, he managed to do it. Yet, the power and will of his brother proved too strong for his seal. he needed a vessel, something to contain the massive forces that were being released by his brother, and for that, he forged a sword, wrought upon dragon flame, it was formed from a nigh-indestructible material known as adamantite, which was known to leak out from rifts formed in space-time.</p>
			<p>The sword and the seal, in the end, did contain Boreas. Still, Eurus had overlooked one key detail, for without chaos, there is no order, they are but two sides of the same coin, an ouroboros locked in combat with itself, neither side can win nor lose, merely deter each other, even then it's not a true victory, for one can never be gone without the end of both. Eurus saw himself fade away, but he had to stop it, there had to be a way for him to come back, he had to go against his nature, he had to create something of his brother's ilk. With his final breath he created something, a human, so unpredictable was its nature, it was sure to unlock his brother one day. Sure his children would have to die out, but weren't they just a single brood in his endless lifetime?</p>
			<p>Man progressed, though it took aeons, he progressed to an age where he was the apex, though many creatures stood in his way, with his fellow men he could conquer them. Man was an ambiguous term by then, he had turned into many different kinds, all so different they could be thought of as entirely different species. dwarfs, elves, gnomes, halflings etc, as they were called, and some were there who were not much different from the original man.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile back to Albert and his friend the worm who had been revealed to be named fm'latgh azanahoth which meant “burning worm” in his language. Albert preferred just to call him Bernie. Albert had to come to conquer quite a large part of his planet. His friend, the worm, had proved to be quite good at conquering and destroying. He was often scouting out planets for life and ransacking those with life. It was on one such excursion that he made a shocking discovery.</p>
			<p>“Sire, the worm has returned with some grave news” the captain of his guards told Albert.</p>
			<p>“Send him in”</p>
			<p>As Bernie entered the room, Albert noticed that he had grown again like he usually did after his excursions, but this time his body was pulsing as if he were scared.” This is terrible! We will be wiped out, our home, the fruits of our toil, this kingdom, all will be destroyed!”.</p>
			<p>“Calm down Bernie!” Albert shouted nonchalantly, not realising the predicament they were truly in.</p>
			<p>“We have faced many hardships before, but we have always bested them in the end and learned something, for all our troubles, surely we can handle this”.</p>
			<p>“This is not a joke Albert, our enemy is not at all like the ones we have fought before. He cannot be defeated by pathetic beings of flesh such as us”.Replied the worm “He is of my kind, but much more powerful, I am a mere speck in comparison to him, even the Excalibur pales in comparison to that behemoth. He is the matured form of my species, and one of his age, with enough time, can consume entire universes, And that is exactly what he means to do!.”Cried out the worm.</p>
			<p>“Well. This is terrible!! we don't have any way to defeat him, if what you say is true, then nothing we could ever do will be able to harm this great enemy. And now, with the Excalibur destroyed, how will we defeat him?”Albert said, realising their peril.</p>
			<p>“Hmmm, there may be a way. The books of this kingdom contain many pieces written by a peculiar character known simply as the “Necromancer”. If anyone knows what powers we can acquire, it's him”.</p>
			<p>“Albert you must search for an answer, I shall try my best to delay the enemy’s coming and buy you time, for now, I shall monitor his movements”.</p>
			<p>“I will do what I can, my friend. Good day and good luck! may this be not the last time we meet”</p>
			<p>And so, Albert went to the cellar of his conquered kingdom while the worm searched the cosmos, for any chance, any foothold, that could be found against their foe, who seemed an insurmountable wall poised to destroy all that they love.</p>
			<p>“This place is so dusty” cough” Did no one ever think to maintain this place?!, all this knowledge left to be food for the rats, I do hope the necromancer's works have not been destroyed”.</p>
			<p>As he was looking through what appeared to be the oldest section of the library, Albert saw a book fall to the floor, it opened itself, and the words inside loomed with a sinister red glow, it read</p>
			<div class="poem">
				<p>Before there was something, <br> In the world, empty, black, <br> There was nothing,</p>
				<p>This power of transubstantiation, <br> From void to form, <br> Lay in the hands of chance, for insurrection,</p>
				<p>But pure chaos cannot conform, <br> And so to prevent misgrowth, <br> Forged was order, eternally uniform,</p>
				<p>Burning hands, Wrought upon the hands of Soth, <br> For the birth of a new world, <br> Chaos and order both.</p>
				<p>Giant rocks, by chaos, unfurled, <br> And by order then, <br> Made swivelling and levelled,</p>
				<p>To fashion these rocks, chaos ybegunne, <br> To make sentient life, first wyrm then plant, <br> And order added his touch again,</p>
				<p>To the wyrms did chaos the power grant, <br> To let their children differ from them, with time, <br> So they may, the world enchant.</p>
				<p>And then pass did a long time, <br> And though they were brothers, birds of a feather, <br> Their love for each other became thin as rime,</p>
				<p>The order saw chaos as a creature of the nether, <br> He wished his realm, <br> Be free of chaos, and instead full of his aether,</p>
				<p>To control the world and take its helm, <br> He devised a plan, <br> That would chaos, overwhelm,</p>
				<p>Forged was a seal, that would from escaping, chaos ban, <br> But to the longwyrm, his own kindred, <br> malevolent, and shan,</p>
				<p>But still chaos leaked, filling order with dread, <br> So he forged a vessel, <br> That would contain the chaos and stop its spread,</p>
				<p>Adamantite body and dragonfire as pestle, <br> It was a sword, <br> That would let its wielder, with any foe wrestle,</p>
				<p>This dark blade, tool of discord, <br> Could fend off, <br> Every foe and every horde,</p>
				<p>The chaos leaking out, would its wielders life scoff, <br> The blade held power, <br> Yet too great for an ordinary auf,</p>
				<p>Even after his victory order turned sour, <br> For he was fading, <br> wondering why even in his final hour</p>
				<p>Without chaos, order would be degrading, <br> Upon realising this, <br> Order created something,chaos masquerading,</p>
				<p>A creature of pure chaos to free him from the abyss, <br> Man he was, <br> To free order and chaos, the fate was his,</p>
				<p>In his final moments order thought of his faux pas <br> Brothers they were and brothers they would remain, <br> To hate his brother,His yearn for order had been the cause.</p>
			</div>
			<p>“Well Well Well, this might just be what we needed, I must ask Bernie to find out its meaning”. Albert goes back to his throne room and waits to set up a beacon for the worm, signalling to him that he has found something.</p>
			<p>“Great work Albert!! This poem is about the dark blade. Do you remember the longwyrm that you slew? It was guarding the blade, it says here that the dark blade has powers so great that no living being can withstand it. I cannot seem to understand this part about the burning hands wrought upon by Soth. Soth means void in my language, but I cannot understand why it would appear in the necromancer's work, could one of my kin have arrived here long ago?”.</p>
			<p>“Whatever it is, the dark blade may be our only way to defeat ‘him’” Albert replied." So when shall we go retrieve it? “My friend, we do not have much time, we must leave immediately, take some food for our journey and let us be off, the kingdom can manage by itself for some time.”</p>
			<p>And so they journeyed, coincidentally through the same path Albert had taken before their first encounter, albeit in the opposite direction. Before long they had reached the lake, but when they saw it, they, or at least Albert, were flabbergasted. The lake had dried out, and now in the middle of it stood a small cluster of dragonroot, which appeared to be hiding a hole in the ground. “Well, now I understand why it said that only once the longwyrms were gone would we retrieve the blade”.Albert said. “So, shall we go in?”Said the worm.” You bet! Come on, I will cut the dragonroot with my sword”. The hole was narrow on the top but inside it was revealed to be quite spacious. When their eyes had finally adjusted to the dark, the two companions saw what appeared to be a cylindrical structure in the middle of the room, on it were written the words in the language of the worm,</p>
			<div class="poem">
				<p>Free the chaos and order shall follow, <br> But it shall consume he who is hollow, <br> Take the cursed blade, all enemies shall fall, <br> Yet the minds of mortals, it shall enthral.</p>
			</div>
			<p>The worm translated it to Albert but Albert seemed unfazed by the warning. “Quite ominous, don't you think? But sadly we cannot turn back, even if we must sacrifice ourselves, though we were selfish back then, now I cannot bear to think about the harm that would come to our subordinates and people, and this world itself, if that monster were to succeed. I suppose even conquerors can become soft, but is it truly for the worse?”Said the worm.</p>
			<p>“I share that feeling my friend, everyone used to make fun of me for being a dwelf , even a human was stronger than me, I resented the world for mocking me for who I was, but now I realise if I had been a better person they wouldn't have turned their backs to me. ”Albert replied,” So, shall I take the sword?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, you should wield it, after all, you were the one to slay its guardian.”</p>
			<p>When Albert went near the cylinder it fragmented into dust and revealed its treasure, the dark blade floated, glowing a deep red. When Albert touched it, the sword seemed to speak. It said,</p>
			<p><span class="bold">”FINALLY, SOMEONE HAS FOUND ME, MY WRETCHED brother had TRAPPED ME IN THIS accursed prison TO EXTEND HIS DOMAIN TO THE WORLD, NOW FREE ME, MORTAL.”</span></p>
			<p>“Bernie, the sword is speaking!”</p>
			<p>“I heard it too, this must have been what the warning was about, don't listen to it”</p>
			<p><span class="bold">“WELL WELL WELL, SO YOU HAVE RETURNED TO OUR WORLD, SCOURGE!”</span> The sword said</p>
			<p>”What? How do you know my language? And what are you talking about, I only came here recently. Who Are You!”</p>
			<p><span class="bold">“YOUR LANGUAGE? AH, OF COURSE, THIS PRISON SPEAKS IN the LIsTENERS TONGUE, but our true languages are the same, I BELIEVE It WAS ONE OF YOUR KIND THAT CAME TO OUR WORLD, BACK WHEN I WAS a young god, WE INHERITED ITS LANGUAGE, BUT IT MEANT TO DESTROY US SO I REDUCED IT TO A WORM, BUT IT HAD SOMEHOW MANAGED TO ESCAPE.</span></p>
			<p><span class="bold">AS FOR YOUR QUESTION, I AM BOREAS, CHAOS INCARNATE, I CREATED THIS WORLD AND EVERYTHING IN IT, NOW, FREE ME!”.</span></p>
			<p>“Not so fast, first of all, why should we free you? The warnings were quite clear in saying not to free you, and besides, we only need the sword for our purpose.” Albert countered.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">“THIS ENEMY YOU SPEAK OF NEEDS MY FULL POWER, YOUR EFFORTS WILL BE FUTILE, A SCOURGE OF THAT AGE CANNOT BE DEFEATED BY MORTALS LIKE YOU, EVEN WITH THIS SWORD, sure that weapon may slay gods, the scourge is not of this world, and his flesh can easily thwart such pathetic attacks. AS FOR THE WARNINGS, THOSE WERE PRODUCED BY MY BROTHER IN HIS EFFORTS TO PREVENT MY RETURN”</span></p>
			<p>“Albert I do not wish to interrupt your conversation, but I can sense a power approaching, I believe it is the enemy. I believe it can sense me, get ready to fight!”Said the worm</p>
			<p>“Time to test the powers of the sword!”Albert replied</p>
			<p><span class="bold">“DON'T SAY I DID NOT WARN YOU, YOU SHALL PERISH.”</span></p>
			<p>An explosion rings outside, an ominous presence appears, and their minds are filled with terror, all except Boreas.</p>
			<p>Albert and the worm head outside the hole to find their gargantuan foe looming above them in the sky, his mere presence made their skin crawl, a ghastly creature, fully black, but a red glow emanated from it. It looked similar to the worm but much larger.</p>
			<p>“Bernie? How do I use the sword?”Albert asked.</p>
			<p>“Ask Boreas, I shall hold off the enemy while you find out.</p>
			<p>But just then, a voice started to speak inside their heads, similar to how the worm spoke to Albert when they first met “No Sword may harm my adamantite flesh, ignorant fools, thou I shall devour, doth thou not see? the world is doomed, my power be far too great for thee to conquer,”</p>
			<p><span class="bold">“THIS WILL BE FUN TO WATCH. AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION, MORTAL BOY, THE SWORD FIRES CRIPPLING ENERGY WAVES, JUST SWING IT AT YOUR FOE, AND MOST ENEMIES WILL BE DESTROYED, FALSE GODS CREATED BY MY BROTHER CREATED A SWORD SIMILAR TO IT, THE EXCALIBUR I BELIEVE IT WAS CALLED, A CHEAP COPY OF MY POWER IT WAS.who could BELIEVE THAT a weapON SUPPOSED TO “SAVE THE REALM” WOULD CRUMBLE AFTER RESURRECTING A SINGLE MORTAL, PATHETIC.”</span></p>
			<p>“Here goes,” said Albert as he swung the sword. A wave of energy released from the sword and hit the foe, but he seemed unfazed.”Bernie, I don't feel so good, I feel faint”</p>
			<p><span class="bold">“AH I FORGOT TO MENTION, THIS SWORD CONSUMES YOUR LIFE ENERGY, THOUGH IT DRAWS UPON MY ENDLESS AURA, IT NEED YOUR ENERGY TO CHANNEL IT, I THOUGHT YOU HAD READ THE WARNINGS? WELL NOW WHAT? DO YOU WISH TO FIRE THE SWORD AND DIE FIGHTING? OR WILL YOU FREE ME AND SAVE THE WORLD? I PROMISE I SHALL DO NO HARM TO THIS WORLD, IT IS MY CREATION AFTER ALL.”</span></p>
			<p>“Albert, we don't have a choice, the sword cannot hurt him, free Boreas, I shall hold off this enemy for as long as I can.”Said the worm, hoping it would not be the last words he said to his friend.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">“GOOD ADVICE I MUST SAY, SO YOU WERE WISE AFTER ALL, SCOURGE, NOW BOY, LISTEN TO HIS ADVICE, FREE ME, OR ELSE YOUR PRECIOUS KINGDOM SHALL BE DESTROYED.”</span></p>
			<p>“Fine, But how do I free you? Should I destroy the sword?”Albert said</p>
			<p><span class="bold">“NO YOU FOOL, THE SWORD IS FORGED FROM ADAMANTIUM, ONLY DRAGONFIRE CAN MELT IT, BUT TO FREE ME, IT IS NOT SO SIMPLE, YOU MUST GO TO THE SHRINE OF THE NORTH WIND, SOME FOOLISH HUMANS BUILT THAT TEMPLE FOR ME THINKING I WAS A MERE WIND GOD, BUT INSIDE IT THERE IS A RELIC CALLED THE ORB OF TIAMAT, I CHAINED SOME OF MY TRUE POWER TO IT, AND I SHALL BE ABLE TO FREE MYSELF USING IT, IT IS NOT FAR FROM HERE, CHANNEL MY POWER THROUGH THE SWORD, IT SHALL HELP YOU REACH THERE, NOW FLY YOU FOOL WE DO NOT HAVE MUCH TIME BEFORE YOUR FRIEND IS CONSUMED.”</span></p>
			<p>And so Albert and Boreas journeyed to the shrine and retrieved the orb, it was a short but eventful journey, yet the chapter would be too long if it is included so it shall be provided later. When they returned, they found the worm missing.</p>
			<p>“WHERE IS BERNIE?!” Albert cried out in dismay.</p>
			<p>A portal appeared above him and the scourge appeared from it. “Fled, hath, thine ally. Finally, thou hath returned to me, I yearn for thine flesh, who be this being beside thee. Mortifying is his presence.”</p>
			<p>“Ymg' need nafl kadishtu ahf' Y' ah, llll h' ah yar llll ymg' l' ah'mglw'nafh”(You need not know who I am, for it is time for you to die) Boreas said.</p>
			<p>“Thou knowest my tongue?! Boreas?! Is it thee? Let me tell thou, thee may have vanquished me before, yet I am stronger now, and now thou doth not have thine brother to help thee. thou shall fall”</p>
			<p>“Uh'eor lw'nafh'nahor underestimates ahagl mghri hai ah'mglw'nafh”(Only the weak underestimate their foe NOW DIE!)</p>
			<p>Words can do no justice to the battle that ensued, albert was not there to see it, as Boreas had teleported the scourge to space to prevent damaging ahog shugnahoth in their fight, the only consequences of the battle that could be seen was that many suns were seen in the sky, In the end, Boreas killed the scourge, making sure to destroy him this time, and then he came back to Albert.</p>
			<p>“Now boy, I shall leave you, my brother is starting to reform, my release has caused him to reappear again, your friend is still alive, he has fled to another dimension to escape the scourge, I must go fight my brother now, take care of your kingdom.”</p>
			<p>“Goodbye boreas, and thank you, but before you go, could you try contacting Bernie and telling him that we won?”</p>
			<p>“I have already done that, he will return once he regains that power, he is quite weak now, be patient boy, haste makes waste”</p>
			<p>After several months, the worm returned, Albert told him all that had transpired, and he was quite ecstatic about it. They returned to their kingdom and lived happily ever after, or did they? Albert, during his journey, had accidentally unleashed a malicious power, which had escaped Boreas’s watchful eyes, surely it wouldn't come back to bite them, would it?</p>
